// STL in C++

STL: Standard template Library
	==> Also called as library of Generic classes and functions
	==> Using STL is much more better because indirectly we are using well-tested classes and functions.
	==> Time saving is one of the biggest advantage.
	
	==> Three main components of STL:
		1) Containers -> stores data i.e. Vector (Use Template classes)
		2) Algorithms -> set of procedure i.e. sorting & searching (Use Template Functions)
		3) Iterators -> object that points to an element in a container (Handled just like pointers)
					 -> Connects Algorithms with Containers
		
	==> Three type of Containers:
		1) Sequence containers -> Stores data in linear fashion i.e vector, list, dequeue
		2) Associative containers -> Direct Access i.e set, multiset, map, multimap -> stores data in tree like structure
		3) Derived containers -> Real world modelling i.e stack, queue, priority queue
		
	==> Sequence containers
		1) Vector: 	Random Access -> fast
					Insertion/Deletion in the middle -> Slow
					Insertion/Deletion at the end -> fast
		
		2) List:	Random Access -> Slow
					Insertion in middle -> fast
					
	==> Associative containers
					-> All operations are fast except random access because it keeps element in kind of tree data structure.
	
	==> Derived containers
					-> Depends on the data structure.
