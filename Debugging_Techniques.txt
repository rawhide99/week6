# Debugging Techniques

1) Using in-circuit emulators
-> Full Access to register and memory
-> Unlimited Breakpoints
-> Trace recording with TimeStamps
-> Output Triggers	

2) On-chip Debugger(in-circuit Debugger)
-> JTAG (Joint Test Action Group), SWO, UART can be used.
-> Now this MCU board is connected using Debug probe with PC/Computer and there we can use GDB
-> Another one is SWD in MCU that is connected via USB to PC and uses PyOCD/GDB.
